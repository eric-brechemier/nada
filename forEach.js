/*
  Run given function for each item in given array,
  including items with null and undefined values

  Parameters:
    array - array, the array to iterate
    callback - function( item, offset ), the callback called at each offset,
               with the item value and current offset provided as arguments.
               If the callback returns true, the iteration is interrupted and
               following items will not be processed.

  Returns:
    boolean, true when the iteration has been interrupted by a callback,
    false otherwise

  Notes:
  * items are processed in ascending order of offset, from 0 to the initial
  length of the array at the time of the call to forEach()
  * in case items are deleted, updated or inserted, the current value of each
  item at the current offset at the time of the call to the callback will be
  provided to the callback
*/

    length = array.length;

  for ( i = 0; i < length && !isBreak ; i++ ){
    isBreak = callback( array[ i ], i ) === true;
  }
