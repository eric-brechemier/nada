nada is better than nothing.

This is a place to collect basic utility functions
and to run associated unit tests.

Each utility function is defined in a separate file,
without a module namespace or dependencies.

To avoid cluttering the global namespace in the browser,
you can wrap these functions in a closure of your choice.
