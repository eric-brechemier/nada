nada is better than nothing.

This is a place to collect basic utility functions
and to run associated unit tests.

FIRST STEPS
-----------

Each utility function is defined in a separate file,
without a module namespace or dependencies.

To avoid cluttering the global namespace in the browser,
you can wrap these functions in a closure of your choice.

Look at unit tests for example of use ; you can find the
documentation of each function in its source code.
